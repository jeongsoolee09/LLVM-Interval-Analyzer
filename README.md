# LLVM-Interval-Analyzer

## What is this?

This repo contains a toy interval (static) analyzer targeting the LLVM IR.

## Extension plan (TODOs)

Don't send PRs, since this is a class homework! (LoL just kidding)

1. Summary-based interprocedural analyzer
2. Extending domain to include access paths
